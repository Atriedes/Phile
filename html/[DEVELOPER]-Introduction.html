<p>In this wiki we have collect some informations for developers. please refer to the pages prefixed with <strong>[DEVELOPER]</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you plan a change at the core, please create first an issue an let us discuss this change, before you do any changes. Not all changes will be accepted by the maintainer of the project, you can save a lot of time if you talk to us, before start coding.</strong></p>
<p>This project is based on <a href="https://github.com/gilbitron/Pico/commit/aa59661ff81dd52c3a2596988372a214b0fc31b9">Pico CMS v0.8</a> by <a href="https://github.com/gilbitron">Gilbert Pellegrom</a>.</p>
<p>The desire to fork the project from Pico, came when a few community members wanted to contribute more and increase the rate of development progress.</p>
<p>The first step was a complete refactoring to use the full power of object oriented programming (OOP). The Core and all components are now object oriented and use modern concept of programming like some design patterns.</p>
<p>please read our other Developer-Pages, which linked on <a href="_pages">Pages</a> and marked with the [DEVELOPER]-Prefix.</p>

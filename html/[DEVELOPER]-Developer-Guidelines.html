<p>Each pull request has to be reviewed by two other people. if the pull request is reviewed by at least two people (give +1 in the comments), one of the maintainer will accept the request and merge it into the core.
The maintainers also has a veto, in cases where the code structure is not ok or an other pull request will add the same feature.</p>
<p>To avoid inconsistencies, looking to the <a href="https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/wiki/Feature-Requests">wiki</a> if someone else is already working on a feature, before you start by your self. lets talk to each other, to improve PhileCMS.</p>
<p>For each pull request please use one of the following prefix:</p>
<h4 id="-feature-">[FEATURE]</h4>
<p>If you implement a new feature, please use this prefix in the title of the pull request.</p>
<h4 id="-bugfix-">[BUGFIX]</h4>
<p>If you fix any bug, please use this prefix in the title of the pull request.</p>
<p>If you fix a already documented bug, pleaser refer to the issue in the issuetracker.</p>
